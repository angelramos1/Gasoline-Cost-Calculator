<h1>Gasoline Cost Calculator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Developed a Python-based application that calculates the total cost of gasoline depending on how many gallons the user needs.
The program allows users to input the desired number of gallons and the price per liter of gasoline since Puerto Ricoâ€™s gas stations have their price in liters.
Implemented a function to convert gallons to liters and then calculate the exact amount to be paid, ensuring accuracy in real-time financial calculations.
